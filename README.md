## Instructions

The starter project has some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Memory Game project. You'll need to convert this project from a static project to an interactive one. This will require modifying the HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JavaScript file.

To get started, open `js/app.js` and start building out the app's functionality

For specific, detailed instructions, look at the project instructions in the [Udacity Classroom](https://classroom.udacity.com/me).

## Contributing

This repository is the starter code for _all_ Udacity students. Therefore, we most likely will not accept pull requests.

For details, check out [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Dependencies

I have used Javascript to code the logic of the game.

I am using EasyTimerJS for adding the timer functionality found here: https://albert-gonzalez.github.io/easytimer.js/

For the icons - I am using FontAwesome version 4.6.1

For the web font I am using Google Font called "Coda".

##How to Play

To start a game just start clicking on the tiles to uncover all pairs.

You are being timed and we count the moves.

You can play again after you solve the all board.

If you get stuck find the replay icon top right of the board to restart the game and timer.

Good Luck Players!
