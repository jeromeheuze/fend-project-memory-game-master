# Memory Game Project

This is a game project for Udacity into making a matching game using Javascript.

## Getting Started

To play the game you just have to execute the file 'index.html' and play the game.

### How to Play

To start a game just start clicking on the tiles to uncover all pairs.

You are being timed and we count the moves.

You can play again after you solve the all board.

If you get stuck; find the replay icon top right of the board to restart the game and timer.

Good Luck Players!

### Dependencies

I have used Javascript to code the logic of the game without frameworks.

I am using EasyTimerJS for adding the timer functionality found here: https://albert-gonzalez.github.io/easytimer.js/

For the icons - I am using FontAwesome version 4.6.1

For the web font I am using Google Font called "Coda".
